🚀 Excited to share my latest project: A Secure User Profile Management System on AWS!
I’ve just completed a full-stack project that focuses on building a secure, scalable, and user-centric Profile Management System. This journey was a great deep dive into handling real-world challenges—from regex-based validation to cloud deployment.

🌟 Key Features & Technical Implementations:

Strict Data Validation: Engineered a custom Regex-based Email Validation system specifically for @gmail.com accounts to ensure high-quality user data during registration.

Secure Authentication: Implemented a session-based login system utilizing Authorization Tokens to protect user requests and prevent unauthorized access.

Dynamic Profile Management: Users can update personal details and upload profile pictures, with updates instantly reflected through asynchronous logic.

Cloud Infrastructure: Successfully hosted and managed the application on AWS EC2 (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS), configuring security groups for secure SSH and HTTP traffic.

🛠 Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap), JavaScript (ES6+)

Backend: PHP (Server-side logic)

Database: MySQL

Cloud: AWS (EC2, Security Groups, IAM best practices)

🚀 Future Enhancements: To further scale the infrastructure, I plan to integrate AWS S3 for media storage and AWS RDS for a managed database experience.
